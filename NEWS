lloconv 6.1.1 (2022-09-27)

* Document more LibreOffice options I've discovered in --help.

* README: Note that LibreOffice requires filenames to have a valid encoding in
  the current locale.

* README: Improve markup.

* configure: Fix handling of `./configure LO_INCLUDE_PATH=...` which was
  previously ignored due to a typo.

* Drop note from `--help` output about LibreOffice options needing 4.3.0rc1
  since we dropped support for LibreOffice < 4.3.0 a couple of years ago.

* The check for upstream builds of LibreOffice is now dynamic and no longer
  hard-codes a list of versions to check for (which required updating with each
  new release).

* Automatically find packaged LibreOffice on 64bit Fedora

* Automatically find LibreOffice on macOS.  Reportedly initialising
  LibreOfficeKit hangs but at least we'll be ready once that is fixed
  by the LibreOffice developers. See
  https://gitlab.com/ojwb/lloconv/-/issues/11.

lloconv 6.1.0 (2018-08-20)

* First actual numbered release.
